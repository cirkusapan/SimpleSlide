SimpleSlide

this is going to be a simple explanation for how and what i want the slider to be able to do!

i want the slider to have 4 buttons: play/stop, Direction Clockwise, Derection ConterClockwise and bounce.
one digital rotory encoder so i can step the speed.
i want a led controller that's controling one or two ledbars indicating speed and current direction.
lastly im going to install a micro switch for startup calibration.

so what do i want the slider to do?

on startup:
i want the slider to move towards the motor until it toutch the micro switch and there sets the minimum distance of the slider.
im not going to install a second micro switch becose i dont want cables to both sides of the slider, want to be able to remove the motor
and crontroler from the slider kind of easy.

while running:
the slider starts at the motor and have a mesured distance it can move in the oppisite direction, this to simplyfi and to be able to have
different sliders with the same code.
if the motor steps the maximum steps indicated in the code the wagon shall stop and chance the direction (if play is played after it has
reached the end it will move the oppisate directin)

      Buttons:
               Play/Stop - As it's named the button is to start the sliders movment and if pressed while moving stops it.
               Direction Clockwise - Sets the direction of motor rotation to clockwise 
               Direction CounterClockwise - Sets the direction of motor rotation to CounterClockwise
               Bounce - a mode toggle that overwrite the stop at end command and instead just changes the direction so the wagon bounce-
               s from side to side
      Digital dial:
               When tured i want the speed variable to increse or decrese and if there is a punch function also reset to defoult speed

Parts i am using!
i will paste part of the ebay links here, im not the tecnical type so it's not me that's deciding the parts :P
